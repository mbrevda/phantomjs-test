This package is a demo of a fully contained client side test using the following:

 * Selenium
 * PhantomJS
 * Webdriver.io
 * Mocha

This project should be OS independent, but some more testing wouldn't hurt. The
idea is to be able to install the full testing suite with just a single command
(i.e. ```npm install```). Its not dependcy-less per se, but it doesn't require
upkeep of anything out of npm. Pull requests welcome!
